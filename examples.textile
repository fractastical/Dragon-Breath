*Examples*

Here is what I include as a part of each deployment:

**Classes**
* TestUtils - Utility for easily generating TestUsers 
* LimitUtils - Utility for dealing Limits in Salesforce
* StringUtils (imported from Apex Commons)
* ListUtils (imported from Apex Commons)
* HTTPUtils (imported from Apex Commons)
* SmartFactory (imported from Botoscloud) 

**Static Resources**
* jQueryUI, including jQuery min
* Blueprint CSS framework
* Additional jquery Validation scripts
* CircleIcon set

**Additional Notes**

This package is maintained in developer org. Each imported resource is maintained as a git submodule. In the case of SmartFactory, the submodule is the repo maintained by Matthew Botos. In the case of Apex-Commons, it is a separate git repo in which changes to unused files are ignored (at some point I may separate all of Apex Commons into separate modules).
